\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The goal of this project was to implement a visual sudoku solver which should be able
to locate a sudoku field in a video taken from a webcam and present the solution of it
directly on the empty cells in the original image. The application should run in realtime
and be capable of solving arbitrary sudokus.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we will describe the methods we used to reach our goals.

\subsection{Finding and preparing the sudoku field}
\label{sec:find}

First of all, the sudoku field must be localized and prepared for further
processing. By means of simplicity we assume that the sudoku field must be
the dominant object in the image. Furthermore, it must be clearly outlined by
an thick dark frame. Most of the sudokus in papers and magazines fulfill this
criteria.

To find the sudoku a contour based segmentation of the image preprocessed by
a Canny edge detector is done. A sample output of the Canny filter can be seen
in figure \ref{fig:canny}. Since a sudoku is always square or rectangular
it will appear as a quadrilateral in the image. Therefore, we can just take 
the biggest convex contour as the contour of the sudoku field.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/canny_frame.png}
        \caption{Original frame.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/canny.png}
        \caption{Output of the canny filter.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Canny filtering}
    \label{fig:canny}
\end{figure}

Most of the time the sudoku will not be presented parallel to image plane so
it will be distorted perspectively. In order to simplify the further processing
we need to remove the perspective by finding a homography between the found
contour and a proper square. Since the contour consists of many points we need
to reduce it to the 4 corner points of the quadrilateral. For that purpose we
implemented an algorithm which approximates
the best fitting quadrilateral to a polygon\footnote{\url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2048024/minimum-area-quadrilateral-algorithm/2050478\#2050478}}.

We also tried to use a Hough-Transformation to find those points but the
other approach appeared to be more robust.

Having the corner points the homography can easily be computed and applied
to the image to perspectively unwarp the sudoku field. Additionally the field
is scaled to a fixed size to avoid scale issues. Figure \ref{fig:unwarping}
shows the unwarping.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.70\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/unwarp_frame.png}
        \caption{Original frame.}
    \end{subfigure}

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.70\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/unwarp.png}
        \caption{Output of the canny filter.}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Unwarped sudoku field.}
    \label{fig:unwarping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Digit Segmentation}

Now that the image of the sudoku field is present without distortion at a
fixed size we can apply a grid to it to roughly divide it into the single
cells. In each cell we have to decide if it contains a digit and segment
it, respectively.

The segmentation of the digits is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:digit_seg}.
The coarse segmentation is done by applying a gaussian blur to remove some
noise followed by an adaptive thresholding
\footnote{\url{http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/miscellaneous_transformations.html\#adaptivethreshold}}. 
In contrast to an ordinary threshold, the threshold value varies locally
depending on the mean value of the pixel intensities in the 
neighborhood around the pixel.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{imgs/segmentation.png}
  \caption{Digit segmentation process.}
  \label{fig:digit_seg}
\end{figure}

Although this operation works pretty well there is often the problem that
parts of the grid lines lie inside the image of the cell. Since these lines
have approximately the same thickness as the digits they can not be removed
by the thresholding. To overcome this issue we assume that a small region
in the middle of the image does only contain pixels belonging to the digit.
Starting from these pixels we start a a connected component search to find the
rest of the digit. All other pixels will be discarded.

\subsection{Digit Classification}

In order to be able to find a solution of the sudoku we must classify the
found digits. First, we were thinking of using an existing OCR framework
for this task. Finally we decided to build our own classifier to have more influence
on the classification.

We evaluated three different types of classifiers for this task: \emph{K-Nearest Neighbor},
\emph{Support Vector Machine} and a \emph{Neural Network}. Each of them can be enabled
during compilation of the application. We have chosen to use the Support Vector Machine
since it yielded the best results. In section \ref{sec:results} we will discuss the performance
of them in detail.

Although there would be the possibility to compute descriptors of the segmented digits
(eg. Histogram of Oriented Gradients) we decided to use the plain binary image data
as input to the classifier.

The only preprocessing steps for the training and classification are:

\begin{description}
  \item[Deskewing:] This operation makes the classification more robust for different
  fonts and for handwritten digits in future. This is done by calculating the central
  moments of the pixels. The skewness is given by the third central moments, which is
  used to construct a affine transformation matrix for deskewing.
  \item[Crop:] Since there is a lot of unimportant background in the digit images, we
  crop the image to only include as much background as required. This is done by finding
  the bounding box of the digit contour.
  \item[Rescale:] The support vector machine requires all training and test data to have
  the same dimensionality. After cropping the image, there is no guarantee, that all resulting
  images will have the same size. We overcome this issue by simply rescaling all input
  images for the Support Vector Machine to size $16 \times 16$. Therefore, every input
  vector has 256 dimensions.
  \item[Principal Component Analysis (PCA):] All of the three classificators are able to
  perform a PCA prior to the training (and consequently, also prior to the classification).
  However, at this time there is no possibility to save and load the PCA, respectively.
  So this feature is disabled by default. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Training data}

The training data for the classificator can be extracted directly from the application. It
provides a gui, which provides the user with a possibility to label the training images
by hand. The application is then able to save the extracted training data to the file system.
The file system structure reflect the labeling. Figure \ref{fig:extract_dlg} shows how the
labeling mechanism works.

\subsection{Sudoku Solving}

\subsection{Presenting the Solution}

The projection of the solution onto the original image is not a big deal, since we already
found the homography as described in section \ref{sec:find}. Therefore we can draw the solution
on the rectified imaged and apply the homography inversely.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The application was developed using OpenCV and Qt. No further libraries were used.

The most important parameters of the implementation can be found in \emph{include/settings.hpp}.
Since these parameters are tweaked to be best for the test system, it may be necessary to
adjust them if you are trying to run the application on other webcams. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evaluation/Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Field Extraction}

In most cases, the field extraction works very well. The performance of it highly depends on the 
parameters \emph{CANNY\_LOW} and \emph{CANNY\_HIGH}. Currently, they are tweaked to yield the best
results for the images delivered by the webcam of the test system.

However, the application is currently not able to distinguish between contours of sudoku fields and
contours of other objects. The only assumptions that were made are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The sudoku field is the most prominent object in the image, therefore the biggest contour
  belongs to the sudoku.
  \item The contour needs to be convex, so all non-convex contours are discarded.
\end{itemize}

If those properties are given within the image, the segmentation of the sudoku field works very well. 

If the motion of the sudoku field in the video is very high, there will be no closed contour of it,
and therefore, the contour will not be recognized. However, the application does not reset everything because
the sudoku was not found in one frame. Instead it waits for 10 frames to decide wether the sudoku is gone
or not.

\subsection{Digit Segmentation}
\label{sec:class_perf}

Since the segmentation of the digits was kept very simple, there are not many things that could go
wrong. For all our tested sudoku sheets the segmentation worked very well. However, there could
be problems, if the font of the digits is very thin. In this case, the adaptive threshold could
possibly removes the digit, but we did not find a sudoku with such a font.

\subsection{Classification}

The classification performance can be measured in many different ways. We have chosen to test the
performance using k-fold-cross validation with $k=10$. Table \ref{tab:class_perf} shows the results
for the three different classificators.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Classificator}          & \textbf{Hit rate}   \\ \hline
    k-nearest Neighbors    & $ 99.243\%$ \\ \hline
    Support Vector Machine & $ 98.481\%$    \\ \hline
    Neural Network         & $ 60.521\%$    \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Performance of the different classificators.}
    \label{tab:class_perf}
\end{table}

The Support Vector Machine and k-nearest Neighbors are very similar with respect to the classification
performance. Anyway, the SVM is a little bit better so it was chosen to be the default configuration.

The Neural Network showed a really bad performance. This is mainly because we did not find good training
parameters for it. Since the training of a nerual network is a long running process and the other 
classificators performed very well, we did not investigate this further. The presented hit rate was
achieved with one hidden layer of $35$ neurons.

\subsubsection{Performance on new Sudoku Fields}

In section \ref{sec:class_perf} the performance on the training set itself was shown but the application
should work with any sudoku. We did not really evaluate this but subjectively we can say, that most
sudokus work out of the box. This is no surprise, because most of the sudokus use a similar fonts with
similar scaling.
