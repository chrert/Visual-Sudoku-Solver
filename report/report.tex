\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The goal of this project was to implement a visual sudoku solver which should be able
to locate a sudoku field in a video taken from a webcam and present the solution of it
directly on the empty cells in the original image. The application should run in realtime
and be capable of solving arbitrary sudokus.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we will describe the methods we used to reach our goals.

\subsection{Finding and preparing the sudoku field}
\label{sec:find}

First of all, the sudoku field must be localized and prepared for further
processing. By means of simplicity we assume that the sudoku field must be
the dominant object in the image. Furthermore, it must be clearly outlined by
an thick dark frame. Most of the sudokus in papers and magazines fulfill this
criteria.

To find the sudoku a contour based segmentation of the image preprocessed by
a Canny edge detector is done. A sample output of the Canny filter can be seen
in figure \ref{fig:canny}. Since a sudoku is always square or rectangular
it will appear as a quadrilateral in the image. Therefore, we can just take 
the biggest convex contour as the contour of the sudoku field.

Most of the time the sudoku will not be presented parallel to image plane so
it will be distorted perspectively. In order to simplify the further processing
we need to remove the perspective by finding a homography between the found
contour and a proper square. Since the contour consists of many points we need
to reduce it to the 4 corner points of the quadrilateral. For that purpose we
implemented an algorithm from \cite{quadrilateral_approx} which approximates
the best fitting quadrilateral to a polygon.

We also tried to use a Hough-Transformation to find those points but the
other approach appeared to be more robust.

Having the corner points the homography can easily be computed and applied
to the image to perspectively unwarp the sudoku field. Additionally the field
is scaled to a fixed size to avoid scale issues. Figure \ref{fig:unwarping}
shows the unwarping.

\subsection{Digit Segmentation}

Now that the image of the sudoku field is present without distortion at a
fixed size we can apply a grid to it to roughly divide it into the single
cells. In each cell we have to decide if it contains a digit and segment
it, respectively.

The segmentation of the digits is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:digit_seg}.
The coarse segmentation is done by applying a gaussian blur to remove some
noise followed by an adaptive thresholding (\cite{adaptive_thresh}). 
In contrast to an ordinary threshold, the threshold value varies locally
depending on the mean value of the pixel intensities in the 
neighborhood around the pixel.

Although this operation works pretty well there is often the problem that
parts of the grid lines lie inside the image of the cell. Since these lines
have approximately the same thickness as the digits they can not be removed
by the thresholding. To overcome this issue we assume that a small region
in the middle of the image does only contain pixels belonging to the digit.
Starting from these pixels we start a a connected component search to find the
rest of the digit. All other pixels will be discarded.

\subsection{Digit Classification}

In order to be able to find a solution of the sudoku we must classify the
found digits. First, we were thinking of using an existing OCR framework
for this task. Finally we decided to build our own classifier to have more influence
on the classification.

We evaluated three different types of classifiers for this task: \emph{K-Nearest Neighbor},
\emph{Support Vector Machine} and a \emph{Neural Network}. Each of them can be enabled
during compilation of the application. We have chosen to use the Support Vector Machine
since it yielded the best results. In section \ref{sec:results} we will discuss the performance
of them in detail.

Although there would be the possibility to compute descriptors of the segmented digits
(eg. Histogram of Oriented Gradients) we decided to use the plain binary image data
as input to the classifier.

The only preprocessing steps for the training and classification are:

\begin{description}
  \item[Deskewing:] This operation makes the classification more robust for different
  fonts and for handwritten digits in future. This is done by calculating the central
  moments of the pixels. The skewness is given by the third central moments, which is
  used to construct a affine transformation matrix for deskewing.
  \item[Crop:] Since there is a lot of unimportant background in the digit images, we
  crop the image to only include as much background as required. This is done by finding
  the bounding box of the digit contour.
  \item[Rescale:] The support vector machine requires all training and test data to have
  the same dimensionality. After cropping the image, there is no guarantee, that all resulting
  images will have the same size. We overcome this issue by simply rescaling all input
  images for the Support Vector Machine to size $16 \times 16$. Therefore, every input
  vector has 256 dimensions.
  \item[Principal Component Analysis (PCA):] All of the three classificators are able to
  perform a PCA prior to the training (and consequently, also prior to the classification).
  However, at this time there is no possibility to save and load the PCA, respectively.
  So this feature is disabled by default. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Training data}

The training data for the classificator can be extracted directly from the application. It
provides a gui, which provides the user with a possibility to label the training images
by hand. The application is then able to save the extracted training data to the file system.
The file system structure reflect the labeling.

\subsection{Sudoku Solving}
After we processed the digits it was time to actually solve the sudoku. Therefore we 
implemented a class \emph{Sudoku} which provides all the necessary data and the solving 
algorithm, as well. Among a variety of algorithms which are capable of solving sudoku puzzles,
we decided to use the \emph{Backtracking Algorithm}. The basic idea is to enter numbers which
do not violate the sudoku conventions cell by cell in the empty cells. Each entry then changes
the possible numbers of the next cell. When the point is reached where an empty call has no 
possible numbers anymore, the algorithm goes back recursively to the previous cell and changes the value to
the next possible number or goes back another cell, if the current cell has no candidates, either.
How the algorithm works in detail is shown in figure \ref{fig:backtracking}.

\begin{figure}[h!btp]
   \centering   
   \begin{subfigure}[b]{\linewidth}
     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking1.png}\label{fig:b}  
     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking2.png}\label{fig:c}
     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking3.png}\label{fig:d}
     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking4.png}\label{fig:e}

     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking8.png}\label{fig:i}
     \includegraphics[height=0.1\textwidth]{imgs/backtracking9.png}\label{fig:a}
   \end{subfigure}
      \caption[Solving a 6x6 Sudoku puzzel with Backtracking]{\scriptsize{Solving a 6x6 Sudoku puzzel with Backtracking. 
        It can be seen, that the solver enters possible numbers in each empty cell one after the other 
        (concerned number are shown in red). In picture five and six it can be seen that the numbers 5 and 6 in the first row are 
        changing position. Because of a lack of possible numbers in picture number seven, the algorithm steps
        back till the first empty cell and enters the next and in this case final value 5 in the field which 
        can be seen in picture number nine, where the sudoku if fully solved.}}
   \label{fig:backtracking}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Presenting the Solution}

The projection of the solution onto the original image is not a big deal, since we already
found the homography as described in section \ref{sec:find}. Therefore we can draw the solution
on the rectified imaged and apply the homography inversely.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The application was developed using OpenCV and Qt. No further libraries were used.

The most important parameters of the implementation can be found in \emph{include/settings.hpp}.
Since these parameters are tweaked to be best for the test system, it may be necessary to
adjust them if you are trying to run the application on other webcams. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evaluation/Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Field Extraction}

In most cases, the field extraction works very well. The performance of it highly depends on the 
parameters \emph{CANNY\_LOW} and \emph{CANNY\_HIGH}. Currently, they are tweaked to yield the best
results for the images delivered by the webcam of the test system.

However, the application is currently not able to distinguish between contours of sudoku fields and
contours of other objects. The only assumptions that were made are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The sudoku field is the most prominent object in the image, therefore the biggest contour
  belongs to the sudoku.
  \item The contour needs to be convex, so all non-convex contours are discarded.
\end{itemize}

If those properties are given within the image, the segmentation of the sudoku field works very well. 

If the motion of the sudoku field in the video is very high, there will be no closed contour of it,
and therefore, the contour will not be recognized. However, the application does not reset everything because
the sudoku was not found in one frame. Instead it waits for 10 frames to decide whether the sudoku is gone
or not.

\subsection{Digit Segmentation}

good for tested fields
could fail for thin fonts

\subsection{Classification}

hit rate of 0.99 using k-fold cross validation on training data
for new fonts: a few pics improves significantly

\subsection{Sudoku Solver}
The sudoku Solver, as it is implemented in the class \emph{Sudoku} is capable of solving a larger variety of 
sudoku fields than the image processing part is able to process. Sudoku fields in the size of 16x16 can be solved.
A plain field of that size needs 257 iterations of the recursive backtracking algorithm and 2176 different tries.
But at this size is then the limit for the algorithm. A next bigger plain field of the size 18x18 already needs about
9 600 000 iterations and several minutes to be solved on the used machine. But since the program is at its current state made to solve 
sudoku fields of the size up to 9x9 the backtracking algorithm has not been tested on actual sudoku puzzles bigger than 16x16.
\begin{figure}[h!btp]
   \begin{center}
     \begin{subfigure}[b]{\linewidth}
       \includegraphics[height=3.65cm]{imgs/6x6up.png}\label{fig:j}
       \includegraphics[height=3.65cm]{imgs/solver_6x6.png}\label{fig:k}
       \includegraphics[height=3.65cm]{imgs/solver_9x9.png}\label{fig:l}
       \includegraphics[height=3.65cm]{imgs/solver_12x12.png}\label{fig:m}
     \end{subfigure}
        \caption[Different sudoku puzzles with different box sizes]{\scriptsize{Different sudoku puzzles with different box sizes.
         The pictures one and two are both 6x6 sudokus, but their boxes have a different orientation. In the third picture a
         9x9 sudoku puzzle can be seen with an usual quadratic box. The fourth picture shows a 12x12 sudoku again with a rectangular
         shaped box.}}
     \label{fig:boxshapes}
   \end{center}
\end{figure} 
Furthermore also sudoku puzzles with rectangular shaped boxes can be solved. Such puzzles are shown in figure \ref{fig:boxshapes}.
The size of the box has then be initialised in \emph{settings.hpp}. The program may also try to calculate the box size on, but this works only to a certain extend. Despite that
the orientation of the box can not be determined that way.
